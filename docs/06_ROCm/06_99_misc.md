# ROCm miscellaneous issues

## Driver-version compatibility

### 5.2.3 driver version

-   ROCm 5.4.3 appears to work

-   ROCm 5.6.1: 

    -   According to Samuel there are some known issues with queries
        about available memory being off but it hasn't been a blocker for apps.
    -   Peter mentioned that he couldn't get Neko to work with ROCm 5.,6, with a failure in
        `hipDeviceGetStreamPriorityRange` right at the start.
    -   The performance of GPU-aware MPI can be very bad in combination with the Cray MPICH 
        modules on the system in early 2024.

### rocFFT crashes

In some cases, crashes in rocFFT are due to cache overwrite. One workaround that worked in DestinE is 
using
```
export ROCFFT_RTC_CACHE_PATH=/dev/null
```
or
```
export ROCFFT_RTC_CACHE_PATH=/tmp
```

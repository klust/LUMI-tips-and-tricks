## CXI went public

At the end of January 2024, CXI was upstreamed to the 
[libfabric GitHub repository](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric)
in the [libfabric/prov/cxi subdirectory](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/tree/main/prov/cxi),
so it is now possible to build libfabric ourselves (at least once the bugs are fixed,
on February 9 2024 Alfio mentioned that there are still problems with missing header
files etc.)

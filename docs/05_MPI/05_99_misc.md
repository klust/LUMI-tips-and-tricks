## CXI went public

At the end of January 2024, CXI was upstreamed to the 
[libfabric GitHub repository](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric)
in the [libfabric/prov/cxi subdirectory](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/tree/main/prov/cxi),
so it is now possible to build libfabric ourselves (at least once the bugs are fixed,
on February 9 2024 Alfio mentioned that there are still problems with missing header
files etc.)


## Workarounds

-   Containers from before the system update that are built with ROCm 5.x and that import the
    MPI libraries from the system, may produce an error afterwards about not being able to
    find `libamdhip64.so.6`. This is because the GTL library in the MPI libraries from 24.03
    is built for the ROCm 6 runtime.

    Workaround is to try to make the code link with the GTL library from MPICH 8.1.27:
    ```
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cray/pe/mpich/8.1.27/gtl/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```
    in the container.

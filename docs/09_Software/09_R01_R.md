# R tips and tricks

## Misc

-   Some packages are affected because `timedatectl` doesn't work for regular LUMI users
    (with the error message `Failed to query server: Endpoint is not connected`).

    Note that you get the same error message when you actually try to run `sysctl`.

    Workaround: Add the `TZ` environment variable to `.Renviron` as, e.g.,
    `TZ=“Europe/Berlin”`

# Miscellaneous Slurm tips&trics

## System configuration

-   List of nodes with their Slurm features:
    ```
	sinfo -N -o "%N %f"
	```

-   Extensive information about the partitions:
    ```
	scontrol show partition --all
    ```
	With `--all`` to also see hidden partitions.

-   Show topology:
    ```
	scontrol show topology
    ```

-   Show extensive configuration info:
    ```
	scontrol show config
    ```

-   Also interesting:
    ```
	scontrol show assoc_mgr
    ```

## User- or project-related

-   Show which partitions a project has access to:
    ```
	sacctmgr show assoc where account=project_462000087
    ```

-   Show which partitions a user has access to:
    ```
	sacctmgr show assoc format=account,Partition  -p Users=kurtlust
    ```

## Job management

-   History of slurm jobs:
	-   Through `sacct`
	    ```   
		sacct -a
	    ```   
	-   Through `slurm`
	    ```   
		slurm history 2hours -a 
	    ```   
	    or from a particular user:
	    ```   
		slurm history 1day -u <username>
	    ```   


## Misc

		

-   Attach to a running job rather than ssh into a node:
    ```
	srun --pty --jobid <jobid> bash
    ```
    or
    ```
    srun --pty --jobid <jobid> --w <nodename> bash
    ```

-   Testing on LUMI-D:
    ```
	srun -plumid -t30:00 --gres=gpu:1 --pty bash
    ```

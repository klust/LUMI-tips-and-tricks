# Miscellaneous topics: LUMI-O

From the sysadmins:

>   LUMI-O and the HPC side share only datacenter floorspace, power and upstream network connectivity. 
>   They really are separate systems, also in terms of scheduled maintenance and downtime. 
>   So while the HPC system is unavailable the object storage can be used to move their data around.
